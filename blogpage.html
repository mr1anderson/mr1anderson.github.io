            <p class="block">Hi. I'm Shaun Moynihan, an outcome-driven designer focused on creating simple solutions for complex problems. I enjoy collaborating with teams and embracing the intricacies that make your business successful. With over 12 years of SaaS and Enterprise product design experience, I understand the connections between strategy, development teams, and business goals.</p>
            <p class="block">
              Currently, I am working as a freelance designer on a variety of projects with some exciting clients. Until the Spring of 2020, I worked for an app design agency where I led product design and branding projects across Android, iOS, and desktop. Before agency work, I served as Creative Director at Creative Market, where I helped launch their core product. My primary responsibility was to oversee product design and brand development. During my time there, I had the opportunity to lead the pre-launch effort along with the development team. This resulted in nearly 70,000 new user sign-ups in just under nine months. Creative Market went on to be acquired by Autodesk.
            </p>
            <p class="block">Additionally, I have helped design for companies like OpenTable, Expedia, Microsoft, ESPN, Fidelity Investments, AT&T, and Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>
